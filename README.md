# 📈 Stock Price Prediction and Estimation using LSTM

[Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/manasrane/AeroSpaceGE_predictions)

This project implements an LSTM-based model to predict stock price movements using historical time series data. It leverages the sequential learning capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast future closing prices of stocks.

The model was trained and evaluated on [e.g., Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL)] stock data, and includes performance metrics, visualizations, and future price estimates.

### 🔍 Key Features
- LSTM-based deep learning model for time series forecasting
- Preprocessing of stock price data (e.g., normalization, windowing)
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices
- Hyperparameter tuning and loss curve plotting

### 📁 Files
- `LSTM_stock_GE_AERO.ipynb`: Notebook with full workflow (data preprocessing → model → visualization)

### 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add support for multiple stocks with dynamic ticker input
- Deploy model as a Flask API for real-time prediction
- Integrate with Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualization
